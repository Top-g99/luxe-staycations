## üìä **How Rules Work Together**

### **Earning Calculation**
```
Jewels Earned = (Spend Amount / Spend Rate) √ó Bonus Multipliers
Example: ‚Çπ2000 spent = (2000 / 100) √ó 1.5 = 30 jewels
```

### **Redemption Calculation**
```
Redemption Value = Jewels √ó Jewel Rate √ó (1 - Processing Fee)
Example: 100 jewels = 100 √ó 1.00 √ó (1 - 0) = ‚Çπ100
```

### **Tier Progression**
```
Guest starts at Bronze (0 jewels)
‚Üí Silver at 1000 jewels
‚Üí Gold at 5000 jewels
‚Üí Platinum at 15000 jewels
‚Üí Diamond at 50000 jewels
```
